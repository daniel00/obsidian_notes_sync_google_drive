Tell me about your experience going to the beach as a teenager.
Please tell me in detail when you went, who you went with, and what happened.

When I was in high school, I went to Anmyeondo Beach on the east coast with my friends. We fished there but didn't catch anything. So we decided to dig up clams instead of fishing. We dug for clams for 3 hours and were able to catch quite a few clams. But the clams were inedible. All we did was do meaningless labor in the sun for three hours. It was a very difficult but fun memory.

콤보로 문제가 나온다.
주제를 잘 해서 분리해 놓는게 좋겠다.
